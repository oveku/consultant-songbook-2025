I walked in young with a dream in my hand
They told me welcome to the biggest show in the land
But behind those glass walls the elbows were sharp
And the leaders ruled the room with a cold corporate heart
They gave me a coach who was meant to lift me high
But it all depended on who he knew and who he liked
I worked hard every day, thought results would break through
But here it’s coffee talk and small talk that decides what you do

I got the Accenture blues in a world of purple and grey
Promises sound big but they fade away
They freeze the pay while the pressure grows
And the ladder keeps rising though the value never shows
Still the people shine bright, they get me through
Yeah, I got the Accenture blues

They said the world is open but they move me around
No talk of what I want or the life I’ve found
The culture’s smiling wide but the words taste sweet
While they shuffle all the workers like pieces on a sheet
Training’s for the chosen, the higher they stand
The rest of us keep running with no helping hand
And the meetings drag on with that positive spin
But you feel like a stranger in your own career skin

I got the Accenture blues in a world of purple and grey
Promises sound big but they fade away
They freeze the pay while the pressure grows
And the ladder keeps rising though the value never shows
Still the people shine bright, they get me through
Yeah, I got the Accenture blues

Some nights I wonder if I should stay or go
’Cause the folks are amazing, but the system runs the show
Global winds blow cold and the local team bends
And the stories they promise rarely match how it ends
But I pack my bag, take another long stride
Hoping someday this road will open wide
Till then I keep singing, nothing left to lose
Just a tired consultant with the Accenture blues
